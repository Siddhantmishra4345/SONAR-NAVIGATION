# SONAR NAVIGATION
# Sonar Signal Classification: Rock vs. Mine

## üåä Project Overview

This project aims to classify sonar signals as either a "rock" (R) or a "mine" (M) based on their acoustic characteristics. The dataset consists of 60 numerical features representing sonar signal patterns and a categorical target variable indicating the object type.

The goal is to build and evaluate various machine learning models to accurately distinguish between these two classes.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing feature distributions and correlations.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilizing PCA for visualizing the data in 2D.
- **Baseline Models**: Implementation and evaluation of K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers.
- **Advanced Models**: Training and hyperparameter tuning of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a simple Neural Network (PyTorch).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Applying K-Means clustering for exploratory data analysis.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive reporting using classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `Copy of sonar data.csv`. It contains:
- **208 instances**
- **60 numerical features** (representing sonar signal attributes)

## üßπ Data Preprocessing & EDA

The initial steps involved:

  - Loading the dataset and examining its shape and first few rows.
  - Converting the categorical target variable ('R', 'M') to numerical (0, 1).
  - Checking for missing values (none were found).
  - Scaling features using both `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` to observe their effect on data distribution. `StandardScaler` was chosen for subsequent modeling.
  - Visualizing the distribution of a sample feature and the correlation matrix of all features.
  - Applying PCA to reduce dimensionality and visualize the data in 2D, colored by their true class labels, to inspect separability.

### Visualizations

(Here, you would include the plots generated in your notebook. Since I cannot directly embed images, I'll describe them.)

  - **Scaler Comparison**: A plot showing the distribution of the first sample after `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` transformations.
  - **Feature Distribution**: A histogram visualizing the distribution of `Feature 0` after scaling, showing its spread.
  - **Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap illustrating the correlation between all features. This helps identify highly correlated features.
  - **PCA Visualization**: A 2D scatter plot of the principal components, with points colored by their class (Rock/Mine). This provides insight into the linear separability of the classes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Baseline Models & Evaluation

The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Three baseline classification models were trained and evaluated:

1.  **K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
2.  **Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**
3.  **Decision Tree Classifier**

Each model's performance was assessed using a `classification_report`, which includes:

  - **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
  - **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
  - **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.
  - **Accuracy**: The overall proportion of correct predictions.
  - **Macro Avg**: The average of unweighted per-class metrics.
  - **Weighted Avg**: The average of per-class metrics, weighted by support.

Confusion matrices were also generated for each model to visually represent true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

### Baseline Model Performance Summaries

(Here, you would insert the classification reports and confusion matrices for each baseline model.)

  - **k-NN Results**: (Example: High F1-score, indicating good balance between precision and recall for both classes.)
  - **Naive Bayes Results**: (Example: Lower F1-score compared to k-NN, suggesting less balanced performance.)
  - **Decision Tree Results**: (Example: Moderate performance, possibly indicating overfitting or underfitting depending on the F1-score.)

## üìà ROC Curves

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for all baseline models. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each, providing a single metric to compare the overall performance of binary classifiers. A higher AUC value indicates better model performance in distinguishing between classes.

### ROC Curves Plot

  - **ROC Curve Analysis**: The plot visually demonstrates the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. AUC values are displayed in the legend.

## ü§ñ SVM & Neural Network

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

An SVM classifier was implemented, and `GridSearchCV` was used for hyperparameter tuning to find the best `C` (regularization parameter) and `kernel` (linear or rbf) for optimal performance.

  - **Best SVM Parameters**: (Example: `{'C': 1, 'kernel': 'rbf'}`)
  - **SVM Classification Report**: (Insert report. Example: SVM generally performs well, especially with optimal hyperparameters.)

### Neural Network (PyTorch)

A simple feedforward neural network was built using PyTorch. The network consists of:

  - An input layer with 60 features.
  - Two hidden layers with ReLU activation.
  - An output layer with a single neuron and Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The model was trained using `BCELoss` and the `Adam` optimizer. The training loss was monitored over 100 epochs.

### Neural Network Training Loss Plot

(Insert training loss plot here.)

  - **Training Loss Analysis**: The plot shows how the loss decreases over epochs, indicating that the model is learning from the training data.

## üîç Unsupervised Learning

K-Means clustering was applied to the `scaled_features` with `n_clusters=2` (since there are two classes in the original data). The clustering results were evaluated using:

  - **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: Measures the similarity of the clustering results to the true labels, adjusted for chance. A value close to 1 indicates perfect clustering, while 0 or negative values indicate random clustering.
  - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Higher values (closer to 1) indicate better-defined clusters.

### K-Means Clustering Results

  - **Adjusted Rand Index**: (Example: `-0.0044`, indicating clustering results are not significantly better than random.)
  - **Silhouette Score**: (Example: `0.1278`, indicating loosely defined clusters.)

### PCA + KMeans Clustering Visualization

(Insert PCA + KMeans scatter plot here.)

  - **Clustering Visualization**: This plot displays the PCA-transformed data points, colored by their assigned K-Means cluster. It helps visualize how well K-Means separated the data in the reduced dimensionality compared to the true class labels.

## üí° Insights & Future Work

### Key Insights

  - **Data Scaling is Crucial**: The comparison of `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` highlights the importance of appropriate data scaling for various models.
  - **Model Performance Varies**: Different baseline models show varying performance, with k-NN often performing well on this dataset, likely due to its non-linear nature.
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning is Beneficial**: GridSearchCV for SVM demonstrated that optimizing hyperparameters can significantly improve model accuracy.
  - **Clustering Challenges**: K-Means struggled to accurately cluster the data into two meaningful groups based on the features, as indicated by the low ARI and Silhouette Score. This suggests that the inherent clusters in the feature space might not directly correspond to the 'rock'/'mine' labels, or that the features are not linearly separable enough for K-Means.
  - **Neural Networks Show Promise**: The decreasing training loss of the simple neural network indicates its potential for learning complex patterns in the data.

### Future Work

  - **More Advanced Feature Engineering**: Explore creating new features from existing ones (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms) to potentially improve model performance.
  - **Ensemble Methods**: Implement and evaluate ensemble techniques like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), and AdaBoost, which often achieve higher accuracy than single models.
  - **Deep Learning Optimization**:
      - Experiment with different neural network architectures (more layers, different activation functions).
      - Utilize dropout for regularization to prevent overfitting.
      - Implement early stopping during training.
      - Explore different optimizers and learning rate schedules.
  - **Advanced Clustering Techniques**: Investigate other unsupervised learning algorithms such as DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering, or Gaussian Mixture Models to see if they can identify more meaningful patterns in the data.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Implement more robust cross-validation strategies (e.g., K-Fold cross-validation) for more reliable model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
  - **Imbalanced Data Handling**: If the dataset were imbalanced (e.g., significantly more rocks than mines), techniques like SMOTE or class weighting would be considered.
  - **Interpretability**: For the best-performing models, explore methods for model interpretability (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.
